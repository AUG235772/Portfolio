## 🛡️ Core Methodology
My approach to digital security is built on a three-phase process:
1. **Identify:** Asset discovery, risk context, and threat analysis.
2. **Strategy:** Security architecture planning and risk-based control selection.
3. **Secure:** Implementation, monitoring, and incident response readiness.
